# Introduction to Generators

**What are Generators?** Generator functions are a powerful JavaScript feature that allow functions to pause execution and resume later, maintaining their context between runs.

```javascript
function* simpleGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const gen = simpleGenerator();
console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
console.log(gen.next().value); // 3
```

## The Three Faces of Generators

Generators have three distinct patterns or "faces" that we'll explore:

1. Generators as Producers
2. Generators as Consumers
3. Generators as Coroutines
